        <p>
            Dr. Reed Richards is a scientist and inventor, better known as Mister Fantastic, who has been considered the
            smartest
            man on Earth.[16] He is a polymath with mastery of all the sciences including; electrical, mechanical, aerospace
            engineering, electronics, chemistry, physics, biology and beyond. Richards was exposed to high levels of cosmic
            radiation along with his best friend Ben Grimm, then girlfriend Sue Storm and her younger brother Johnny Storm,
            during a
            trip to space in the stolen rocket, the Marvel-1. The radiation mutated him and his friends, allowing him to stretch
            and
            mold his body at will.[18] Together they became the Fantastic Four, a team of adventurers who explored space, time
            and
            alternate dimensions and saved the world along the way from science-based threats.

        <h1>Bat Man üòç</h1>
        <p >
        Batman has been Gotham City's protector for decades, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran
        member of the Justice League. Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger. The character
        made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne. Witnessing
        the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a
        bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave, beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler
        Alfred Pennyworth. The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters' roots in film and pulp
        magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of
        intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime.
